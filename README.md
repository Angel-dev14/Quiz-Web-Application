<h1>Quiz Web Application</h1>
A dynamic full responsive web page that allows students and other users to solve quizes with some of the subjects from the Faculty of Computer Science and Engineering in Skopje

It uses a reusable code template that can generate quiz questions from any given json file filled with an array of objects with questions and answers syntax.

It's one of my first projects after learning javascript, jquery and responsive development
